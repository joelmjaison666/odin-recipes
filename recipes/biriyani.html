        Introduction to Biryani
        Biryani is a popular South Asian mixed rice dish made with a combination of basmati rice, spices, herbs, and marinated meat or vegetables. The dish is known for its rich flavors, aromas, and varied textures, which are achieved through a complex cooking process.
